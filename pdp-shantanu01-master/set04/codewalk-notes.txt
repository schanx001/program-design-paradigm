Design:
- Trailpoints , mx and my is missing in the make-circ [Data definition section]
- Circle-new-pos has 9 condition checks i.e. could have been simplified by avoiding the checks for corner of the canvas.
- Suggestion : helper functions in circle-after-key-event could be more descriptive. [No deduction]
- Contract for handle-empty-list2 is not matching and could have simplified instead of using nested if checks

Presentation: 
Good, able to defend his design choices. 
Understood mistake where in use of nested if-checks could have been avoided.

Design Grade:  AB
