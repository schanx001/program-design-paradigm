;; computing the geometry of a perfect bounce

;; a particle is bouncing inside a two-dimensional rectangle,
;; travelling at a constant velocity.

;; given its state at time t, compute its state at time t+1.

;; rules: if the particle would cross any side of the rectangle, at
;; time t+1 it appears on the side of the rectangle at the place it
;; would have hit the rectangle, and its velocity in the direction it
;; hits the wall is reversed.

;; data:

(define-struct particle (x y vx vy) #:transparent)  
(define-struct rect (xmin xmax ymin ymax) #:transparent)
;; all fields are Real.
;; We assume xmin < xmax, ymin < ymax.
;; Furthermore, we assume that the particle is either inside the
;; rectangle or is at the wall and travelling inward.
;; The specifications for the drag operation are supposed to ensure
;; this.

  (let ((px (particle-x p))

;; EXAMPLE:

;; The particle is at (10 20 30 -40).  There is a wall at y = 0.
;; If there were no wall, the particle's next state would be
;; (50 -20 30 -30).  But there is a wall.  The particle reaches y=0
;; at t = 20/40 = 0.5.  So it hits the wall at x = 10 + 0.5*30 = 25,
;; and its y-velocity is reversed.  So the next state is (25 0 30 40),
;; with impact at t=0.5

;; If there were a wall at x=20, it would hit that wall first.
;; Similar arithmetic would apply, and the x-velocity would be
;; reversed. 

;; If there were a wall at x=25, the particle would hit exactly in the
;; corner, at (25,0), and both the x- and y-velocities would be
;; reversed.

;; How to manage multiple walls?  If the x-velocity is > 0, then the
;; ball is guaranteed to hit the xmax wall if it travels long enough.
;; If the x-velocity is < 0, the particle is guaranteed to hit the
;; xmin wall if it travels long enough (and it will never hit the xmax
;; wall). 

;; So we can figure out when the ball will hit an x-wall, and when it
;; will hit a y-wall.

;; Choose the wall it hits first.  If there's a tie, that means the
;; particle will hit in a corner, so it doesn't matter which one we
;; choose. 

;; Find the time of the first collision (or 1 if none), and return the
;; state of the ball at time t.  If the ball is at a wall, reverse the
;; velocity in the direction of the wall.
